## Causal reasoning

Body fat is a measure of the percentage of fat in the body, which is obtained through its estimated density. The measurements obtained from different parts of the body serve as an indication of the respective body shape. Since different tissues (fat and muscle) tend to accumulate in different parts of the body, these measurements are specific measures of the composition of fat and muscle which are encompassed in the body fat equation.
