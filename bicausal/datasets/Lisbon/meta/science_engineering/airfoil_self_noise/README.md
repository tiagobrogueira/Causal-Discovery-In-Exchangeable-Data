## Variables (X → Y)
[Filtered by: free-stream-velocity, chord-length]

- attack-angle → scaled-sound-pressure
- frequency → scaled-sound-pressure
- suction-side-displacement-thickness → scaled-sound-pressure

## Causal reasoning

In this dataset, the sound produced by the airfoil is caused by the impact of wind against the airfoil, of which the causes above are features.
