Number of entries: 591

Variables:
- X: pctprivatecoverage
- Y: target_deathrate

Independence tests:
- **Hoeffding’s D**: D=0.0508 — smaller → more independence (D in [0,1]) (ref: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hoeffding%27s_independence_test)
- Pearson: r=-0.3367, p=4.163e-17 — higher p → more independence (p in [0,1]) (ref: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pearson_correlation_coefficient)
- Spearman: ρ=-0.3688, p=1.899e-20 — higher p → more independence (p in [0,1]) (ref: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spearman%27s_rank_correlation_coefficient)
- KMutualInformation: MI=0.1224 — 0 ≈ independence (MI ≥ 0, unbounded) (ref: Runge, J. (2018). Conditional independence testing based on a nearest-neighbor estimator of conditional mutual information. AISTATS 2018, PMLR 84:938–947)
