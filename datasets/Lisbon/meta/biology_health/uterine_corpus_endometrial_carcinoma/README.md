## Variables (X → Y)
- Fraction Genome Altered → Mutation Count
- microsatellite instability score(MSI MANTIS Score,MSIsensor Score) → Mutation Count

## Causal reasoning

The effect in this dataset is called mutation count. This is the number of point mutations present in the uterine cancer analysed. These mutations can be caused by the age of the patient, large structural instability (fraction genome altered) or microsatellite instability.
