- Y: ViolentCrimesPerPop

Independence tests:
- **Hoeffding’s D**: D=0.02231 — smaller → more independence (D in [0,1]) (ref: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hoeffding%27s_independence_test)
- Pearson: r=-0.2105, p=2.098e-21 — higher p → more independence (p in [0,1]) (ref: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pearson_correlation_coefficient)
- Spearman: ρ=-0.2735, p=1.597e-35 — higher p → more independence (p in [0,1]) (ref: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spearman%27s_rank_correlation_coefficient)
- KMutualInformation: MI=0.1006 — 0 ≈ independence (MI ≥ 0, unbounded) (ref: Runge, J. (2018). Conditional independence testing based on a nearest-neighbor estimator of conditional mutual information. AISTATS 2018, PMLR 84:938–947)
