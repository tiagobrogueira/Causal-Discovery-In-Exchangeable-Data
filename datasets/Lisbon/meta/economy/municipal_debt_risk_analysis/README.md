- debt value(avgreceipting,propertysize,propertyvalue,totalreceipting) → debtbillingratio
- debt value(avgreceipting,totalreceipting) → total90debt

In this dataset, the causal factors are loan-related features (such as billing, receipting, and property values), which influence composite measures (ratios) and affect the likelihood of default, reflected in indicators like write-offs and 90-day debt.
