Variables:

- Y: wage_eur

Independence tests:
- **Hoeffding’s D**: D=0.05147 — smaller → more independence (D in [0,1]) (ref: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hoeffding%27s_independence_test)
- Pearson: r=0.206, p=9.808e-144 — higher p → more independence (p in [0,1]) (ref: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pearson_correlation_coefficient)
- Spearman: ρ=0.3414, p=0 — higher p → more independence (p in [0,1]) (ref: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spearman%27s_rank_correlation_coefficient)
- KMutualInformation: MI=1.623 — 0 ≈ independence (MI ≥ 0, unbounded) (ref: Runge, J. (2018). Conditional independence testing based on a nearest-neighbor estimator of conditional mutual information. AISTATS 2018, PMLR 84:938–947)
