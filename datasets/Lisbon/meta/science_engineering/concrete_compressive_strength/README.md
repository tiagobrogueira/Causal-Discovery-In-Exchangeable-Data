## Variables (X → Y)
- Age → Concrete compressive strength
- Cement → Concrete compressive strength
- Superplasticizer → Concrete compressive strength
- Water → Concrete compressive strength

## Causal reasoning

In this dataset, the causes are different ingredients that create concrete. The mixture proportions has an effect on the concrete's compressive strength.

## Notes:

Present in the Tübingen dataset.
